# Binary Tree & Binary Search Tree

* A tree whose elements have at most 2 children is called a binary tree. Since each element in a binary tree can have only 2 children, we typically name them the left and right child.

* A binary search tree, also known as ordered binary tree is a binary tree wherein the nodes are arranged in a order. The order is : a) All the values in the left sub-tree has a value less than that of the root node. b) All the values in the right node has a value greater than the value of the root node.
